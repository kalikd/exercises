Write code which will iterate array1 elements, convert elements at odd index in “Upper Case” and elements at even index in “lower case”. After conversion, add element in array2.

For example

array1 = ["Pak", "Ind","Lhr","Isb","PHYsics"]

After your code is executed


array2 should contain ["pak", "IND","lhr","ISB","physics"]
